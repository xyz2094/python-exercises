### Python OOP Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating core Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) concepts. Each file is a self-contained example designed to be clear and
easy to understand.

All scripts are standalone and can be run directly from your terminal.

How to run:

```bash
# General command format
> py <folder_name>/<file_name>.py

# Example
> py Inheritance/simple_inheritance.py
