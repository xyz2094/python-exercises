### Python OOP Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating core Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) concepts. Each file is a self-contained example designed to be clear and
easy to understand.

All scripts are standalone and can be run directly from your terminal.

1.  **Navigate** to the root directory of the project.
2.  **Execute** any script using the `python` command, followed by its path.

```bash
# General command format
python <folder_name>/<file_name>.py

# Example
python 2-Inheritance/simple_inheritance.py
